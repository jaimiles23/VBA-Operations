## Personal Workbook
VBA Macros are tied to workbooks. For instance, a user may write a VBA macro within an Excel workbook and then that macro is saved within that Workbook.  Office-365 Applications also contain a **Personal Workbook** A personal workbook is tied to your Office Account and is accessible between files. 

Your Excel personal workbook is available here - you will almost never need to access is manually. Office-365 applications will automaticlaly load the workbook with the application:
    `C:\Users\User Name\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel\XLSTART`
